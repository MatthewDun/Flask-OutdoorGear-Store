This is a work-in-progress store!

Goals:

    Create a website where users can upload a photo and set a price for an item to sell in the store.

    Implement user account creation and login functionality.

    Apply security skills to prevent attacks such as SQL injection, directory traversal, remote file inclusion (RFI), and other common threats.

    Learn to use SQL and implement a secure database.

Timeline:
I plan to finish this project by the beginning of September!
